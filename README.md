## Welcome to The Uninstaller

The Uninstaller is an application that allows you to completely remove applications and all their installed contents from your Mac. 
Installing an application distributes many files throughout your System using space of your Hard Drive unnecessarily.
The Uninstaller finds all these small files and safely deletes them.
